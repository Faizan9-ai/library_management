# library_management
This project implements a Library Management System using MySQL, designed to manage books, borrowers, library branches, and book loans. It demonstrates practical SQL skills such as data modeling, joins, aggregation, and subqueries to answer complex real-world questions.
The main objective of this project is to build and query a relational database that mimics a real-world library system. The database includes tables for:

Books

Library Branches

Borrowers

Book Loans

Authors

Book Copies
